# NOTES

- need N-by-3 arrays to store positions, velocities, forces

- please do not create N-by-N arrays (don't store all atomic separations/pair forces)

- please comment code :)

- background on mol sim file formats - will be useful later on
- for simple applications: XYZ is very simple to work with
- life saving - openBabel, avogadro for converting trajfile formats
