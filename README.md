# MOLECULAR DYNAMICS
Author: "Samuel Chen"


# USAGE
- change only the values in main in md.jl to run different simulations.
    - to disable PBCs, set `L = 0`. this will ensure the code never alters 
    particle positions.
    - to disable cutoff radii, set `cutüìè` to -1.
- run all of `VelocityVerlet.jl` and all of `ReadWrite.jl` before running `main.jl`;
this ensures that the functions from those two files are loaded in
- 

# GLOBAL ASSUMPTIONS
- Œµ, œÉ, and m are all 1.
hopefully, this will hold true and I won't have to go back and insert these
everywhere.

# TODOs
PS #4:
- Implement the Nos√©-Hoover thermostat
    - `vv_one_timestep!`: update the thermostat term after updating positions
    - new function: implement thermostat updates
    - `update_üöós!`: include push from thermostat as well
- MSD calculation
    - keep track of unadjusted positions

LONG-TERM:
- IN PROGRESS: improve variable names
- NOT STARTED: improve the style and interface, make the interface more opaque
and easier to continue running from the top level without having to change my
interfaces each problem set
    - implement a struct to pass along simulation parameters so i dont have to
    do like five runs just to debug my interface


# NOTES

- use N-by-3 arrays to store positions, velocities, forces
- please do not create N-by-N arrays (don't store all atomic separations/pair forces)

- please comment code :)

- background on mol sim file formats - will be useful later on
- for simple applications: XYZ is very simple to work with
- openBabel, avogadro can convert trajfile formats


PS # 3:
- 3
    - redo the density calculations. solid state should be around 1 particle per
    1 cubic non-dimensional
    - change box length so the initial particle positions don't really have to
    change
